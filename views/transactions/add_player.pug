block description
  p
    | To add a player to a roster you must specify the league, team and player keys, respectively.
  p
    | Currently, we can only add 1 player at a time, but I will update the library to support multiple adds in the near future!
  p 
    | You must be authenticated as the team owner add players to teams. It would appear being league commissioner does not allow you to override this.
